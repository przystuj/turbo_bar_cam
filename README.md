## Parameter Adjustment System

TurboBarCam includes a powerful parameter adjustment system that allows you to fine-tune camera behaviors. You can adjust these parameters using keybinds or commands.

### Adjustment Format

The general format for adjustments is:
```
turbobarcam_[mode]_adjust_params [action];[param],[value];[param2],[value2]...
```

Where:
- `[mode]` is the camera mode (fps, orbit, tracking_camera, group_tracking, etc.)
- `[action]` is one of:
  - `add`: change a value by the specified amount (can be negative)
  - `set`: directly set a parameter to a specific value
  - `reset`: restore all parameters to defaults
- `[param]` is the parameter name
- `[value]` is the amount to change or the absolute value to set

### Adjustable Parameters

#### FPS Camera Parameters
- `HEIGHT`: Camera height above unit (range: 0+, default: 60)
- `FORWARD`: Forward/backward offset (negative = behind unit, default: -300)
- `SIDE`: Left/right offset (negative = left, default: 0)
- `ROTATION`: Horizontal rotation in radians (default: 0)
- `MOUSE_SENSITIVITY`: Sensitivity for free camera mode (range: 0.0001-0.01, default: 0.003)

**Important**: When you rotate the camera using the `ROTATION` parameter, the `FORWARD` and `SIDE` parameters will still work relative to the unit's orientation, not the camera's view direction. This means they might appear to work in unexpected directions after rotation, as they're tied to the unit's coordinate system rather than what you see on screen.

#### Orbit Camera Parameters
- `HEIGHT`: Camera height above unit (range: 100+, changes with unit type)
- `DISTANCE`: Orbit radius (range: 100+, default: 800)
- `SPEED`: Orbit speed in radians per frame (range: -0.005 to 0.005, default: 0.0005)

#### Unit Tracking Parameters
- `HEIGHT`: Look-at point height offset (range: -500 to 400, default: 0)

#### Group Tracking Parameters
- `EXTRA_DISTANCE`: Additional distance beyond calculated value (range: -1000 to 3000, default: 0)
- `EXTRA_HEIGHT`: Additional height beyond calculated value (range: -1000 to 3000, default: 0)
- `ORBIT_OFFSET`: Orbit angle offset in radians (range: -3.14 to 3.14, default: 0)
- `SMOOTHING.POSITION`: Position smoothing factor (range: 0.001-0.2, default: 0.03, lower = smoother)
- `SMOOTHING.ROTATION`: Rotation smoothing factor (range: 0.001-0.2, default: 0.01, lower = smoother)
- `SMOOTHING.STABLE_POSITION`: Smoothing for when units are barely moving (range: 0.001-0.2, default: 0.01)
- `SMOOTHING.STABLE_ROTATION`: Rotation smoothing for when units are barely moving (range: 0.001-0.2, default: 0.005)

#### Anchor Parameters
- `DURATION`: Transition time in seconds (range: 0+, default: 2.0, 0 = instant transition)

#### Overview Camera Parameters
- `DEFAULT_SMOOTHING`: Camera movement smoothing (range: 0.001-0.5, default: 0.05)
- `FORWARD_VELOCITY`: Movement speed (range: 1-20, default: 5)
- `MAX_ROTATION_SPEED`: Maximum rotation speed (range: 0.001-0.05, default: 0.015)
- `BUFFER_ZONE`: Center screen dead zone (range: 0-0.5, default: 0.10)

## Example Adjustments

```
/turbobarcam_fps_adjust_params add;HEIGHT,10;FORWARD,-20
```
This increases camera height by 10 and moves it back by 20.

```
/turbobarcam_orbit_adjust_params add;SPEED,0.0002
```
This increases orbit speed by 0.0002 radians per frame.

```
/turbobarcam_fps_adjust_params reset
```
This resets all FPS camera parameters to their default values.

```
/turbobarcam_anchor_adjust_params set;DURATION,0
```
This sets anchor transitions to instant (no smooth transition).

## Camera Modes

### Camera Anchors

Camera anchors allow you to save camera positions and smoothly transition between them. They're especially useful for spectating and for quickly switching between different areas of the battlefield.

**Usage Example**:
1. Position your camera where you want
2. `/turbobarcam_anchor_set 1` (saves the position as anchor 1)
3. Move camera elsewhere
4. `/turbobarcam_anchor_focus 1` (smoothly transitions back to anchor 1)

**Focus While Tracking**:
The `turbobarcam_anchor_focus_while_tracking` command has different behaviors depending on the current state:
- If FPS, orbit, or unit tracking is active: Camera moves to the anchor position while continuing to look at the tracked unit
- If no tracking mode is enabled: Behaves like a regular transition to the anchor

### FPS Camera

The FPS camera attaches to a unit and follows its movements, providing a first-person-like perspective. You can adjust height, forward/backward position, side offset, and rotation to get the perfect view.

**Usage Example**:
1. Select a unit
2. `/turbobarcam_toggle_fps_camera` (camera attaches to the unit)
3. Use adjustment commands to adjust the view

**Auto-orbit**:
When enabled, auto-orbit automatically transitions from FPS mode to orbiting when a unit stops moving for a configurable period. When the unit starts moving again, it transitions back to FPS mode. Think of it as an "idle animation" for the camera that adds visual interest when units are stationary.

**Free Camera Mode**:
While in FPS mode, you can toggle free camera control that allows you to manually control the camera direction while still following a unit's position.

**Usage Example**:
1. While in FPS mode for a unit
2. `/turbobarcam_fps_toggle_free_cam` (enables mouse control of camera)
3. Use mouse to look around while still following the unit

**Fixed Point Tracking**:
While in FPS mode, you can set a fixed point for the camera to look at, which is useful for keeping your focus on a specific area while your unit moves around.

**Usage Example**:
1. While in FPS mode for a unit
2. Click the "Look point" command from the order menu or use the bound key
3. Click on a location or unit you want to focus on

You can bind the `turbobarcam_fps_set_fixed_look_point` command to a key for quicker access when selecting fixed look points.

### Tracking Camera

The tracking camera follows a selected unit but doesn't change the camera's height or rotation unless you move it manually. It's useful for following units while maintaining your preferred viewing angle.

**Usage Example**:
1. Select a unit
2. `/turbobarcam_toggle_tracking_camera` (camera will track the unit)

### Orbiting Camera

The orbiting camera circles around a selected unit at a configurable speed. It's especially useful for inspecting units or watching battles from different angles.

**Usage Example**:
1. Select a unit
2. `/turbobarcam_toggle_orbiting_camera` (camera starts orbiting)
3. Use speed adjustments to change orbit speed

### Overview Camera (Work in Progress)

The overview camera provides a strategic top-down view with multiple zoom levels and cursor-based rotation. It's perfect for getting a better understanding of the battlefield layout.

**Usage Example**:
1. `/turbobarcam_overview_toggle` (enables overview mode)
2. `/turbobarcam_overview_change_zoom` (cycles through zoom levels)
3. `/turbobarcam_overview_move_camera` (moves camera to cursor position with smooth tracking)

**Note**: The overview camera is still under development and may be completely redesigned in future versions.

### Group Tracking Camera (Work in Progress)

The group tracking camera follows multiple selected units, automatically calculating the center of mass and ideal viewing distance. It's perfect for keeping track of a squad or group of units.

**Usage Example**:
1. Select multiple units
2. `/turbobarcam_toggle_group_tracking_camera` (enables group tracking)
3. Use adjustment commands to fine-tune the view

**Note**: The group tracking camera is still being refined. It may have issues with units that rotate frequently (like "stationary" aircraft) and may undergo significant changes in future versions.

### Auto-orbit

When enabled in the CONFIG settings, auto-orbit automatically transitions from FPS mode to orbiting when a unit stops moving for a configurable period. When the unit starts moving again, it transitions back to FPS mode.

## Spectator Features

TurboBarCam includes special features for spectators, including the ability to create and manage unit groups. While spectators cannot directly control units, this feature allows for quickly switching between tracked units without having to find them on the map again.

**Usage Example**:
1. When spectating, select units you want to track frequently
2. `/spec_unit_group set 1` (saves selected units as group 1)
3. Later, `/spec_unit_group select 1` (selects all units from group 1)
4. Use any tracking feature with the newly selected units

**Note**: Spectator unit groups only work in spectator mode, and are particularly useful for quickly switching between important units during casts or when analyzing games.

## Multi-Mode Keybinding

Since mode-specific actions only work when the corresponding mode is active, you can bind different actions for different modes to the same key. For example, you could bind numpad 8 to increase height in FPS mode, adjust distance in orbit mode, and change zoom in overview mode.

## Tips and Tricks

- Use camera anchors with different transition durations for cinematic effects
- Combine anchors with tracking for powerful spectating tools
- Free camera mode works great with fixed point tracking
- FPS camera settings are remembered per unit type
- The overview camera's smoothing can be adjusted for more responsive or cinematic movement
- Auto-orbit provides nice visual variety during gameplay
- In group tracking mode, try different orbit offsets to find the best angle
- Bind common adjustments to easily accessible keys for quick fine-tuning
- When a unit gets below your camera in FPS mode, you can briefly flip to orbit mode and back to quickly reposition behind it
- Set the anchor transition duration to 0 for instant camera jumps

## Configuration

The widget comes with sensible defaults, but you can modify many settings in the `camera_turbobarcam_config.lua` file to customize the experience to your preferences.
