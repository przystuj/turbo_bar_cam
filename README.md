## Getting Started

By default, TURBOBARCAM is loaded but disabled. To enable it:

```
/toggle_camera_suite
```

Once enabled, the camera will center on the map and switch to FPS mode. Now you can use all the features described below.

## Camera Modes

### Camera Anchors

Camera anchors allow you to save camera positions and smoothly transition between them. They're especially useful for spectating and for quickly switching between different areas of the battlefield.

**Usage Example**:
1. Position your camera where you want
2. `/set_smooth_camera_anchor 1` (saves the position as anchor 1)
3. Move camera elsewhere
4. `/focus_smooth_camera_anchor 1` (smoothly transitions back to anchor 1)

### FPS Camera

The FPS camera attaches to a unit and follows its movements, providing a first-person-like perspective. You can adjust height, forward/backward position, side offset, and rotation to get the perfect view.

**Usage Example**:
1. Select a unit
2. `/toggle_fps_camera` (camera attaches to the unit)
3. Use offset commands to adjust the view

### Fixed Point Tracking

While in FPS mode, you can set a fixed point for the camera to look at, which is useful for keeping your focus on a specific area while your unit moves around.

**Usage Example**:
1. Enable FPS camera for a unit
2. Click the "Look point" command from the order menu
3. Click on a location or unit you want to focus on

### Free Camera Mode

Free camera mode allows you to manually control the camera direction while still following a unit's position.

**Usage Example**:
1. Enable FPS camera for a unit
2. `/fps_toggle_free_cam` (enables mouse control of camera)
3. Use mouse to look around while still following the unit

### Tracking Camera

The tracking camera follows a selected unit but doesn't change the camera's height or rotation unless you move it manually. It's useful for following units while maintaining your preferred viewing angle.

**Usage Example**:
1. Select a unit
2. `/toggle_tracking_camera` (camera will track the unit)

### Orbiting Camera

The orbiting camera circles around a selected unit at a configurable speed. It's especially useful for inspecting units or watching battles from different angles.

**Usage Example**:
1. Select a unit
2. `/toggle_orbiting_camera` (camera starts orbiting)
3. Use speed adjustments to change orbit speed

### Overview Camera

The overview camera provides a strategic top-down view with multiple zoom levels and cursor-based rotation. It's perfect for getting a better understanding of the battlefield layout.

**Usage Example**:
1. `/turbo_overview_toggle` (enables overview mode)
2. `/turbo_overview_change_zoom` (cycles through zoom levels)
3. `/turbo_overview_move_camera` (moves camera to cursor position with smooth tracking)

### Auto-orbit

When enabled, auto-orbit automatically transitions from FPS mode to orbiting when a unit stops moving for a configurable period. When the unit starts moving again, it transitions back to FPS mode.

## Spectator Features

TURBOBARCAM includes special features for spectators, including the ability to create and manage unit groups. While spectators cannot directly control units, this feature allows for quickly switching between tracked units without having to find them on the map again.

**Usage Example**:
1. When spectating, select units you want to track frequently
2. `/spec_unit_group set 1` (saves selected units as group 1)
3. Later, `/spec_unit_group select 1` (selects all units from group 1)
4. Use any tracking feature with the newly selected units

**Note**: Spectator unit groups only work in spectator mode, and are particularly useful for quickly switching between important units during casts or when analyzing games.

## Tips and Tricks

- Use camera anchors with different transition durations for cinematic effects
- Combine anchors with tracking for powerful spectating tools
- Free camera mode works great with fixed point tracking
- FPS camera settings are remembered per unit type
- The overview camera's smoothing can be adjusted for more responsive or cinematic movement
- Auto-orbit provides nice visual variety during gameplay

## Configuration

The widget comes with sensible defaults, but you can modify many settings in the `camera_turbobarcam_config.lua` file to customize the experience to your preferences.
